# Austin Bike Sharing Project

Austin B-cycle is a public bike sharing program that rolled in to Austin in December 2013. The system is owned by the City of Austin and operated by the local 501c3 non-profit Bike Share of Austin. It being a very successful bike-sharing programs in the country, currently has 72 B-cycle stations around downtown Austin.

For this project, I was tasked with analysing data to find patterns in behavior to detect market trend (OR demand trend) and to recommend 2 - 3 key insights for stakeholders.

**Problem statement**: 
To generate behavioral insights from Austin Bike Share Trips datasets to help stakeholders manage operation planning (e.g. fulfilling demand and servicing)

**Objective of the project:** 
- To utilise Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns in users' behavior to detect market trend (OR demand trend)
- To recommend 2 - 3 key insights

**Workflow:**
1. Querying in data
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Conclusions & Recommendations
